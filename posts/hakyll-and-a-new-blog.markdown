This is my first post on my new blog which is generated using [the
fantastic Hakyll package.](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/)

I previously used my Blogination package which also statically
generated blogs, but it wasnâ€™t that flexible and you needed to hack on
the actual source to change your blog. It was also quite slow. It was
nice though ([example
blog](http://blog.nicolaspouillard.fr/tags/blogination.html)) and I
got a taste for static generation and liked it.

I could possibly do with adding a feed.

Hopefully soon I will have more time for personal open source projects
and blogging about them.
