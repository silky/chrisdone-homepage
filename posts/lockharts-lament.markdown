Oh. My. God. What a fantastic paper! A Mathematician's Lament by Paul
Lockhart. I have never been so moved and compelled by a text on
mathematics in my life.

I found it, by chance, looking on my rarely-used Macbook, and sat down
to read...

It was like reading a synthesis of all the thoughts I've ever had
about a subject but had never verbalised. Ever had that? When reading
something is like *remembering*?

I won't paraphrase what's written in it. You can go read it
yourself. You should. I should think that *all* mathematicians, and
anyone in the field of education should have read this by now.

## Another Brick in the Wall

Lockhart writes of the poor sod subjected to this every day. I was one
of those students. I suppose many reading this will be, too, right?

I was given the UK-equivalent of the K-12 education program. The "ladder
myth", as Lockhart puts it so well. Right from childhood from 5, to the
end of high school at age 15. From the mid-90s to the mid-00s.

If you were to generate a montage from my memory of maths education,
it would go something like this:

The screen ripples and a smattering of voices and sights are
heard. The monotonous "one-times-seven-is-seven, two-times-seven-is
fourteen, ...", followed by, "to do long division you draw two lines
like this...", "repeat after me, the square on the hypoteneuse is
equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides," we repeat,
"the square on the ...", and "SOH-CAH-TOA, this is all you need to
remember ...", and every couple years, "you're going to need this on
the exam, so pay attention ..."

Monotonous, boring, stressful.

## You'll be sent to cleaning asking questions like that...

There are a few times that I remember, when, despite it, I had
some sparks of curiosity.

One example that I distinctly remember, which made an impression on
me, was that I suddenly wanted to know how to calculate the area of a
sphere. It just proposed itself and wanted to be answered.

At the end of class I asked something like, "How do you work out the
area of a sphere? I mean, it's not πDh, I think that's a cylinder, I
don't know how to make it shrink like a sphere..." (Look, I had no
mathematical intuition *whatsoever*!)  He turned to me with an uncertain
look, and told me that it was too advanced, and not in this level of
curriculum. That was the answer. I remember walking away for lunch,
dejected. My rare spark of curiousity put down.

It kills me that with a more capable teacher I would've learned
something that day. I can't fathom the kind of intuition I would have
now if I'd've been taught from primary school by someone like
Lockhart.

## On confidence

My experience with art and programming is the
opposite. Those are two things that I've always loved, and subjects that
I took by choice.

Every step of the way was figured out by experimentation, exploring. I
had never read a drawing or programming manual, nothing about
algorithms, or even syntax. I just tried things and looked at
examples. I sweated, got confused, pushed through, and learned how to be
stubborn for the rewards that came after it. I had gained *confidence*
for art and programming. Whatever it was, I'm sure I could figure it
out.

With maths, I have *never* had such confidence. I still don't. Even the
mention of maths puts a sinking feeling in my stomach. Maths is like
some trauma I've experienced, and I can only handle it in small
doses. When I approach something unfamiliar, my brain shuts down. I
don't have that confident spark like I do with art or programming, I
have fear and doubt and confusion. I don't feel that if I sit and bash
my head against it that I'll persevere. I'll just fail.

I'm not alone. This is the doctrine described in Lockhart's fantastic
paper.

## Self-expression

One art teacher once gave me a profound peace of advice, it was
something like this:

> Next time you sketch something, Chris, I don't want you to use a
> rubber. And I want you to go wild, go crazy with it, don't care about
> it being neat. Do a few instead of just one. See what you come up
> with.

In other words, to express myself. Draw what you feel. Do something new,
individual to you.

I high school we were taught with LOGO. What a great time that was!
Spending an hour trying to figure out how do draw pretty things. Think
of anything you want to see. Then struggle for half an hour. Then see
it!  *That* is how you introduce people to programming.

## As a career skill

Lockhart addresses the inevitable criticism that careers demand
certain expertise:

> SIMPLICIO: Fair enough.  But what about those students who are
> interested in pursuing a career in science or engineering?  Don’t they
> need the training that the traditional curriculum provides?  Isn’t
> that why we teach mathematics in school?
>
> SALVIATI: How many students taking literature classes will one day be
> writers? That is not why we teach literature, nor why students take
> it.  We teach to enlighten everyone, not to train only the future
> professionals.  In any case, the most valuable skill for a scientist
> or engineer is being able to think creatively and independently.  The
> last thing anyone needs is to be trained.

D'accord! I cannot speak for mathematicians, or people in physics or other
"applied maths". But I can speak for programming. Every skill I have now
that I use in my job, I gained myself. Like so many programmers. We're
often entirely self-taught.

## Not just maths

In fact, programming education suffers from the same problems, it's
boring, uncontextualised, incompetently taught, career-focused. With the
exception of a few universities, and LOGO class. I went through college
and my degree bored out of my wits. I think you tend not to notice the
awful state of programming education because it's not mandatory, taught
in schools since primary school. As in the paper:

> There is surely no more reliable way to kill enthusiasm and interest
> in a subject than to make it a mandatory part of the school
> curriculum.  Include it as a major component of standardized testing
> and you virtually guarantee that the education establishment will suck
> the life out of it.  School boards do not understand what math is,
> neither do educators, textbook authors, publishing companies, and
> sadly, neither do most ofthe problem is so enormous, I hardly know
> where to begin.

## Conclusion

Finally, ending on the most important message: mathematics is
art. Programming is art. Painting is art. Poetry is art. They *cannot*
be ruined like this. We have a lot to think about regarding
education. We also have a lot to answer for to Logic, a field which
could be taught from primary school, which would bring us inconceivable
benefits. But that's for another write-up.

## Funny bits

Here're some funny bits that tickled me from the paper.

> Does any middle school algebra teacher have the slightest clue why he
> is asking his students to rephrase “the number x lies between three
> and seven” as |x - 5| < 2 ?  Do these hopelessly inept textbook
> authors really believe they are helping students by preparing them for
> a possible day, years hence, when they might be operating within the
> context of a higher-dimensional geometry or an abstract metric space?

And Bertrand Russell, the legend:

> English teachers know that spelling and pronunciation are best learned
> in a context of reading and writing.  History teachers know that names
> and dates are uninteresting when removed from the unfolding backstory
> of events.  Why does mathematics education remain stuck in the
> nineteenth century?  Compare your own experience of learning algebra
> with Bertrand Russell’s recollection: “I was made to learn by heart:
> ‘The square of the sum of two numbers is equal to the sum of their
> squares increased by twice their product.’ I had not the vaguest idea
> what this meant and when I could not remember the words, my tutor
> threw the book at my head, which did not stimulate my intellect in any
> way.”
