## Story of the Tree

Hui Tzu said to Chuang Tzu, “I have a big tree of the kind men call
shu. Its trunk is too gnarled and bumpy to apply a measuring line to,
its branches too bent and twisty to match up to a compass or
square. You could stand it by the road and no carpenter would look at
it twice. Your words, too, are big and useless, and so everyone alike
spurns them!”

Chuang Tzu said, “Maybe you've never seen a wildcat or a weasel. It
crouches down and hides, watching for something to come along. It
leaps and races east and west, not hesitating to go high or low-until
it falls into the trap and dies in the net. Then again there's the
yak, big as a cloud covering the sky. It certainly knows how to be
big, though it doesn't know how to catch rats. Now You have this big
tree and you're distressed because it's useless. Why don't you plant
it in Not-Even-Anything Village, or the field of Broad-and-Boundless,
relax and do nothing by its side, or lie down for a free and easy
sleep under it? Axes will never shorten its life, nothing can ever
harm it. If there's no use for it, how can it come to grief or pain?”

## Swine

I don't know from where I heard this.

If you take pigs from the forest and raise them in the farm, they know
how to be farm pigs. If you take the adult pigs and put them back in
the forest, they do not know how to be forest pigs and they will die
in short order. The forest is their natural Way and yet by being put
into use by man they lose their ability to be useless.

## The Bull

There's a Zen story I heard a while ago, related to the previous. If
you watch the movie Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, the
opening scene is an act of this.

A bull escapes from his master and runs into the forest. There in the
forest he grunts and stands around in peace. He turns left and looks
at his surroundings. He turns right and breathes in the cool night air
and listens to the insects chirping and the leaves blowing. After a
while of this, he doesn't know what to do. His master approaches
slowly with a rope and stands a few metres away from the bull. The
bull does not move. The master swings a rope around the bull and tugs
once. The bull does not react angrily. The master pulls on the rope
again and the bull gives up and turns around, following his master
home.

## Lesson

Your own Way is your natural state of being. To be used and controlled
by others is to pervert your natural state and confuse yourself. It
takes careful self-observation to limit your use to others. In modern
life, it is practically impossible to do so. You are the pig. You are
the bull. But try to be the tree, as much as you can. Grow in your own
way, like the tree. It's not growing for any purpose or use, **it's
just growing**.
