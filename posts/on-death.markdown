I quite like listening to Alan Watts talks while doing things around
the house.

But one point I'd like to touch upon is that I don't quite take Alan's
views on death as readily as his other views.

The recent movement of philosophy about transhumanism is at odds with
the classical religions of the last thousand years, because they all
deal with death in terms of acceptance. They say, don't commit
suicide, going on living is fun and you should explore. But then they
say "but death comes to us all sooner or later, so don't fear it when
it comes." I consider this a contradiction.

Consider the recent tale of the
[Dragon Tyrant](http://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html). The
dragon in the story represents death. The town that the dragon
terrorizes and from which demands are made for human sacrifices
serving as meals for the dragon, over time, come to accept the dragon
as a fact of life. People who point out the fact that the dragon is
obviously bad are seen as trouble makers and youths. After so many
generations, the dragon is just how things are, and the sooner you
come to terms with it, the better.

If and when technology arises for us to either "upload" to some
limitless quantum computer, or more likely in the coming century to
apply therapies to extend life to the point that they can be extended
and rejuvenated indefinitely, religions will have to re-think their
views on what it means to be alive and the role death plays in life.

Is almost all ancient theology dealing with death by trying to justify
it as if it has a good purpose, when really they had no choice other
than to frame it so, because they lacked the technology to have it any
other way? Life and death is yin and yang, black and white, they
say. You can't have one without the other. Poetic, but true?
