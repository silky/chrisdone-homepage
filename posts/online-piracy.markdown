I just bought Louis CK's latest standup for $5 from [his web
site](http://www.louisck.net).

## The business model

He was very transparent about his business model, production (he
produced it by himself) and how much money he made.

* He produced everything himself.[^3]
* He got the web site made to be very easy to buy his material with no
  annoying sign-up process[^2].
* The money goes straight to him[^1].
* He earned >$1,000,000.
* He donated $280,000~ to charity.
* Put $250,000~ back into his business.
* $250,000~ for bonuses for the people who work for him.
* Pocketed $220,000~.

So:

* Good for Louis CK.
* Good for Louis CK's employees.
* Good for the charities:
  [Fistula Foundation](www.fistulafoundation.org/),
  [Green Chimneys](http://www.greenchimneys.org/),
  [CharityWater](http://www.charitywater.org/),
  [Pablove Foundation](http://pablove.org/) and
  [Kiva](http://www.kiva.org/).

## The price

$5 is nothing. That's the price of a pizza and a drink. I actually
wanted to pay more, I would've if the interface allowed me to.

## The distribution

The download was perfectly done.

* It's available world-wide. No locality nonsense.
* After paying, access to the download was immediate.
* There were options for medium or high definition quality.
* There were no restrictions on using the video afterwards; feel free
  to watch it on your computer, burn it to DVD, whatever.
* A maximum of three downloads, which is reasonable; bandwidth costs
  money.

## The content

Well, it's Louis CK. He's a quality comedian and his material is fresh
every year. I cried a bit with laughter watching it. I won't spoil
anything from it. You can go download it for 5 bucks.

## Lesson learned

For a least a famous comedian,

* putting out material to be freely downloaded,
* for a reasonable price,
* with transparency of business model, and with
* clear indication that the money will go straight to the artist

it works. As Louis said on his blog:

> I really hope people keep buying it a lot, so I can have shitloads
> of money, but at this point I think we can safely say that the
> experiment really worked. If anybody stole it, it wasn't many of
> you. Pretty much everybody bought it.

It ends up convenient, fast, legal *and* there is the warm feeling
that I am supporting the artist, and encouraging them to produce more
material.

With the traditional means of production and distribution, Louis
would've made more money merely to perform it, but the content would
have been restricted and the price would've been jacked up.[^4]

## Applying it to movies and television generally

The same could be done for movies (and television, but after this I
will say ‘movies’ as a generic term). It could, but I doubt it
will. For the following reasons:

* Most movies are low quality. They're not worth watching.
* They're not worth the money paid for them or the time wasted
  watching.
* Movies are produced by large faceless production companies that
  nobody gives a shit about.
* Their business model is based on targetting the most people with the
  most generically pleasing content, not high quality content. They're
  making millions this way and have no incentive to do it
  differently. Therefore their movies are shit.
* The writer, director and actors get a cut of this huge pot, and
  therefore are also happy with writing, directing and appearing in
  shit movies.
* People don't really care about whether they're hurting the movie
  industry by downloading them for free, because of the above. It's
  not a loss.

Contrast this to Louis CK; his audience knows what he puts out will be
quality. And they know that paying for his material will help him to
produce more. They care about his work.

[^1]: From his blog, “keeping as few people between you and me as
      possible in the transaction.”

[^2]: The website cost him $32,000.

[^3]: From his blog, “I directed this video myself and the production
      of the video cost around $170,000. (This was largely paid for by
      the tickets bought by the audiences at both shows).”


[^4]: From his blog “As of Today, we've sold over 110,000 copies for a
      total of over $500,000. Minus some money for PayPal charges etc,
      I have a profit around $200,000 (after taxes $75.58). This is
      less than I would have been paid by a large company to simply
      perform the show and let them sell it to you, but they would
      have charged you about $20 for the video. They would have given
      you an encrypted and regionally restricted video of limited
      value, and they would have owned your private information for
      their own use. They would have withheld international
      availability indefinitely.”
