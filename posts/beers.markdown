Thought I'd make a page of all the beers I've been trying. A
beerlog. A bleeg! I'll update this specific page when I try new beers
from now on.

## Chimay Bleue

This is a delicious beer! Chocolately texture, very rich tastes and
pleasant aftertaste. High alcohol content but you don't notice it.

## La Trappe Blond

I love this beer. Very fruity. Big bottle, good for an evening. I've
had this a couple times now.

## La Chouffe

This is one tasty beverage. Not fruity, almost meaty to me. It goes
well with some pasta ragù di carne. I've had this twice and loved it
each time. Not so many beers have such a full, unique taste. Comes in
a large bottle a la Trappe Blond, good for an evening beer.

## Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Märzen

Hated it! It's an interesting beer with a definite smokey taste, but I
simply don't like this type of beer, I discovered while drinking
it.

* Enjoyed: ✗
* Would drink again: ✗
* Would recommend: If you like smoked beers.

## Leffe Radieuse

This beer surprised me with how quality it was. It's high
alocoholic content, at 8.5%, but the bottle is small, and actually you
cannot really taste the alcohol, it's very fruity and has
character. It's suitable to drink one bottle with a glass of water and
something savoury to eat. It's rather sweet and does not go well with
sweet foods.

## Aldaris Dūmaku

An award-winning Latvian unfiltered beer which has a tasty texture;
put it in the freezer for a short while and get it out when the bottle
has a sheen of condensation over it. Lovely!

* Enjoyed: ✓
* Would drink again: ✓
* Would recommend: If you like slightly bitter beers.
