The issue is that languages don't go forward, they move sideways or
diagonally, or sometimes backwards.

A new car comes out, and it has some cool feature: Hey, it has road
surface detection and changes the steering accordingly! But it should
also come with all the old stuff that you come to expect. Comfy seats,
seatbelts, airconditioner, heated windows, wipers, proximity
detection, power steering, cruise control, etc.

With new programming languages, what you tend to get is a chassis,
engine and steering wheel, and the road surface detection.

Here is a list of cool ideas that have been discovered and implemented
in programming languages, but which do not in their whole make up any
existing language:

The moral is, if you're inventing a new general purpose programming
language and you have some clue that it's going to be adopted, I
implore you to thoroughly explore all of the features above within the
existing languages that do them well, and think about adding it to
your language.

As a follow-up post I might make a table of the top, say, 30, general
purpose programming languages.

[^1]: Also known as quotation, quasiquotes, macros, templating,
      mixins, etc.
[^2]: Also known as "hot-swapping", "live update", "plugins", etc.

[^3]: Also known as implicit parameters, contexts, etc.

[^5]: So, numbers, strings, vectors, patterns, etc.
