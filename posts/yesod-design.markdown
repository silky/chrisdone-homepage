Was messing about in Inkscape and thought I'd come up with a design
for [Yesod's home page.](http://www.yesodweb.com/)
The [HTML build is here.](http://chrisdone.com/designs/yesod-homepage/) Took a
couple hours to whip up a logo and the
design. [Original mock-up here.](http://chrisdone.com/designs/yesod-homepage/yesod.png)
Build to HTML seems to be a success. Took an hour or so to whip up the
HTML & CSS.

[Possible wide version here for reading docs.](http://chrisdone.com/designs/yesod-homepage/yesod-wide.png)

I quite like the Droid font family.
