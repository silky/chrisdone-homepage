There are some common issues with communication that I've yet to see
named, so I'm going to describe and name them here.

## Teaching Mode

I see this one often. It is what someone enters upon hearing a
differing opinion and after which any further dissenting opinion is
interpreted as a failure to understand their teachings: this is no
longer an argument, but rather, I am a teacher and you are being a
belligerent student in need of correction.

## Question Avoidance

Nobody asks clarification questions, because that has an exchange
overhead, and people are afraid of asking questions. It's easier to
make some presumptions about the person you're talking to and their
opinion, and start talking.

## Consequences

There's also the very common and tragically simpler case in which
someone hasn't expressed themselves in a way that another is used to,
and this is interpreted as ignorance or a differing opinion, when in
reality there's been a simple misapprehension. Use of differing
terminology for the same conceptual ideas, for example. Coupled with
question avoidance this often leads to teaching mode.
