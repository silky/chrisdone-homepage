For some reason, I don't actually remember why, one day two weeks
back, I felt that I'd had enough of social network web
sites. Speculating, it was probably that I'd found myself in a trivial
discussion about minutae of some things that didn't matter at
all. Actually, on second thoughts, I think I just read a page of
reddit or twitter and realised I didn't care about any of the topics,
at all.

At any rate, since then, I added these to my `/etc/hosts`:

    192.0.0.1	reddit.com
    192.0.0.1	twitter.com
    192.0.0.1	plus.google.com

Also, no IRC.

And I must say my life has improved since. I've gone out more and done
more things in the past two weeks than I have in months. I get more
done at work, I read or tidy up instead of aimlessly checking all the
social network sites.

It's surprising how often I open a new tab in Chrome to /r/haskell,
almost automatically. Any seconds of time that I have to wait for
something, my hands just open it up. But now that page never loads,
and I close the tab, and think about something else.

I've since commented these out for about 5 minutes to post a couple
things, but immediately re-enabled them. I think this was a good
idea.
