Last week I read the title of a TED talk that read, “Before I die I
want to…” And I thought about that question, and the first thing that
came to mind was to sky dive. It's the thing that I've always wanted
to try, but have always been too scared to do.

Yesterday I went for a sky dive.

It was everything I hoped it would be. The instructors were confident,
friendly and warm. During the flight upwards, I felt, “maybe this
wasn't such a good idea”. And with that feeling, I knew it was a
fantastic idea. To do what frightens me! Leaning out of the plane,
every fibre of my body said “er, no, I don't think so” but away I
went, I clung onto thin air and let fate take its course, and soaked
in the rush of falling at 200 kilometers per hour.

After a full minute of that, I and the instructor appreciated the
gorgeous view as we glided around with the opened parachute. It was a
perfect, blue-sky day.

Best decision I've made in a long time!
