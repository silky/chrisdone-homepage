title: ‘amb’ operator and the list monad

A friend was
[messing about with the `amb` operator](http://mihai.bazon.net/blog/amb-in-javascript/take-two)
in JavaScript after seeing it in Common Lisp.  The `amb` (or
*ambiguous*) operator, first described by our pal John McCarthy
(1967), and something I first
[encountered in SICP.](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-28.html#%_sec_4.3)

These kind of constraint/logic puzzles seem naturally solved by the
list monad,
[here's an example of solving ‘Who owns the fish?’](http://hpaste.org/45504/who_owns_the_fish)
Similar to
[the Zebra puzzle.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle)
