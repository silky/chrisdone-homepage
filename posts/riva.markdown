Last Sunday I visited [Riva del
Garda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riva_del_Garda) (“shore of the
lake”) for the first time. It's surprising that I never went, I just
“never got around to it”.

It is of course wordlessly beautiful. The color of the water is a
deep blue and it shimmers with turquoise and sunshine. I went on a
perfect day, the sun was hot—sunbathable, and I did—and the sky was
blue.

It's a little touristy, of course, and it's funny to hear English
people trying to pronounce Italian ice creams and such, they make
absolutely zero effort to do it in an Italian accent, it makes me
laugh.

I went and sunbathed for a wee while by the waves and I haven't been
so comfortable in public like that before.

This time I went by bus, but next time I will go by bike. It's about
25 miles away, and there is a path to ride which follows the river.
