[Referring to Mark Kermode's Creature Feature blog post](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/markkermode/2011/11/creature_feature_1.html)

The first physical manifestation that springs to mind for me is in The
Others; the scene when Grace’s daughter is playing on the floor,
turned away from her, and she notices that the hand of her daughter is
an old woman's hand, but her child's (humming) voice remains
normal. Grace approaches slowly to face her and sees an old woman's
face who says in her child's voice, ‘I Am your daughter, are you mad?’
Grace then goes a bit mental and shakes the torso and stops when the
now-returned daughter cries.

This short scene seriously freaked me out when I first saw it, shivers
went down my spine, and still gives me the creeps to this day. And I
find it very difficult to explain. It's not that old people are so
frightening, they're just old.

At a guess, it may be that the juxtaposition of children, who are
supposed to be reliably innocent with the strange and unsettling. (The
Exorcist, Omen, anyone?) At a deeper level, you could even consider
the whole scene as a metaphor for the struggle between a parent and
their child, as the child becomes more mature, independent, behaves
unpredictably and strangely, this frightens and alienates the parent.

A more recent disturbing monster was from the TV show The Walking
Dead, the pilot episode (imho the only episode worth watching), in
which the protagonist and two survivors (father and son) of The Zombie
Apocalypse are camping in the dark in the house of father and
son. Turns out that the mother was zombified and, at night, the
zombies start strolling around in their slow, confused state, and the
mother zombie, who isn't so disfigured, but has VERY good make-up to
just appear more gaunt and animalistic, with empty, dead eyes, still
dressed in her night gown approaches the front door of the house, and
rattles the door handle, evidently recalling some distant memory of
this house, and then peers into the peep hole which the protagonist is
peering through on the other side. Very, very, eerie and disturbing.
