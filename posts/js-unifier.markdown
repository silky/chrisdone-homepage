Wrote a
[simple JS unifier here](/code/js/js-node-unifier-2011-09-05.js). Not
verified correct. See test cases in `unify_test`. Also, for a laugh, [a
unification-based searcher](/code/js/js-node-logic-2011-09-05.js) a la logic languages.

JS is a bad language to implement such a thing, lacking algebraic
types and pattern matching, among other faults.
