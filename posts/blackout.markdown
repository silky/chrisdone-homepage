Sometimes, you see something that makes you re-evaluate your
habits. You realise your habits don't give you much entertainment,
learnings or happiness. You think about other activities that are
better for your personal development, your perspective and your
education. You think more about the things you would like to learn,
the places you would like to travel to, performances and gatherings
you'd like to experience. You think about applying discipline to
separate your work from your free time. Maybe your free time should be
applied more carefully. Sometimes, you need catharsis and change.

Perhaps 2014 will be the year of online silence. Silence from myself,
and silence from outside. Time to learn, reflect, grow. I will write
an update post in January of 2015 about this topic, and I will
continue writing blog posts, working on my open source projects, and
reading and responding to email. If you want to contact me, send me an
email. Otherwise, consider this a complete Internet blackout.
