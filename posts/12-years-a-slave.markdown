Wow. I just watched it. I'll be thinking about this film for a long
time.

Naturally, I immediately jumped onto Wikipedia to find when slavery
was abolished in the US. In 1865 the U.S. abolished slavery with the
Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution.

It goes to show how ineffectual Quenten Tarantino is. Django wasn't
daring, it wasn't harrowing, it was one big joke, a big revenge genre
exploitation movie. But Tarantino himself saw it as bringing slavary
to the foyer (as if no one else has been doing so).

Chiwetel Ejiofor is stunning. At one point in the film he looks
directly at the camera for a long time. He looks right into your
eyes. Wonderful scene.

Michael Fassbender is brilliant and convincing as this lascivious
power mad drunk with no conscience. There's a tense scene between him
and Chiwetel, stood in the dark with lamplight only that is perfect.

Brad Pitt kind of sticks out like a sore thumb, but I didn't mind his
part. He lectures a bit but it wasn't too contrived. I didn't find
Benedict Cumberbatch's accent too convincing. Sarah Paulson was quite
hard to read, which I liked. Her character is conniving.

I was struck in the first few minutes by footage of a paddle
steamer. The paddles on the paddle wheel are red and they're splashing
through the ocean continuously. There is a bunch of visual metaphor in
the movie like that.

I was also struck by a scene where a slave runs to his master and hugs
him, and they walk away arm in arm. That kind of relationship in the
age of slavery is almost more eye opening than all the violence put
upon Lupita Nyong'o's character. Slaves are so happy to be with their
master in servitude, than the unknown hell that awaits them elsewhere
in America.

At one point I realised it kind of reminded me of The Pianist.

There was one line in the movie that floored me, said by the wife of a
slavemaster to a distraught and crying slave who'd been separated from
her children, with the faintest air of pity,

“Your children will soon be forgotten.”
