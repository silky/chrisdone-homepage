Last night I just walked into a sea of students, got a beer and
started chatting to random people. It's useful that people into rock
music tend to be easy to spot: long hair, wearing black, etc. we ended
up going to a show of a cover band of The Doors.

But in fact that was on another night, this night it was a cover band
of rock 'n' roll music. My dad would've loved it. At first there were
like three people in the crowd, later on there was a full crowd and
people dancing 50s style. It was great!

At the end a few of the band members asked how I knew all the songs, I
was like… my dad… they played all the classics. Even “don't roll those
bloodshot eyes at me.”  I requested next time they play that they play
Runaway by Del Shannon.

All in Italian. One thing I've learned is to avoid Italians who can
speak English, because they will use it every chance they get, and
anything they try to teach you about Italian in English just doesn't
sink in. So, all the Italians at work fall into that category.

But talking to someone who can only speak Italian, at a bar or the
cinema or w/e, they say one word and you remember it forever. It just
gets absorbed. Learn loads just by talking. So I tend to avoid people
who can speak English. Like “sorry my English is not good”, I'm like
‘PERFETTO!’ I expect (or hope) my Italian fluency will explode once
I've moved downtown. As will the number of social events I visit!
