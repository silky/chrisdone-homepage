**Update**: It seems that we are in agreement on the theme. I've begun
  [a HaskellWiki page](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Brand) prescribing
  the brand, and guides of how to migrate or design existing sites in
  this theme.

There are points that need to be agreed upon by the community:

* The palette
* The target audience

## Palette & Theme

We used to have a palette of green and purple:

* [Old logo](http://www.haskell.org/haskell-symposium/Images/HaskellLogo.gif)  — old palette
* [New logo](http://haskellwebnews.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/haskell-logo-variation.png?w=500)  — old palette
* [Haskell Platform logo](http://www.haskell.org/wikiupload/7/7d/Platform.png)  — subdued old palette

Now we have randomness:

* [New logo, haskell.org](http://www.haskell.org/wikistatic/haskellwiki_logo.png) — grey palette
* [New logo, haskell.org/platform](http://www.haskell.org/platform/) — blue palette

Haskell sites have no consistent common palette or theme:

* [Haskell.org](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell) — grey, blue and orange
* [Haddock](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/lens/3.9.0.2/doc/html/Control-Exception-Lens.html) — grey, blue and orange
* [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/hackage.html) — no particular palette
* [λ Paste](http://lpaste.net/) — old palette
* [Try Haskell](http://tryhaskell.org/) — old palette
* [Haskell News](http://haskellnews.org/) — bootstrap palette
* [Language report](http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/) — zero palette
* [Hoogle](http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/) — purple
* [Hayoo](http://holumbus.fh-wedel.de/hayoo/hayoo.html) — google
* [Planet Haskell](http://planet.haskell.org/) — no particular theme
* [Haskellers](http://haskellers.com/) — red and blue

## Audience

The target audience can be:

* Existing Haskell users
* Programmers interested in Haskell
* Businesses interested in Haskell

Our existing sites target:

* Haskell.org — programmers interested in Haskell
* Haddock — our haddocks mostly target experiences Haskellers, with little tutorial or example in the general
* Hackage — seems to target Haskell newbies who've never heard of Cabal
* λ Paste — general functional programmers wanting to paste something
* Try Haskell — complete Haskell newbies
* Haskell News — anyone interested in Haskell
* Language report — unclear, anyone?
* Hoogle — people who are new to Hoogle, but already know Haskell
* Hayoo — general Haskellers
* Planet Haskell — anyone interested in Haskell
* Haskellers — business
* FP Complete — business

## Next steps

The next steps are:

* Decide on a theme
* Use that theme across the board
* Consolidate the audiences and make clear navigation paths between the subsites
* Make haskell.org sell itself better to the audience we decide it should aim at

Here is Bootstrap (which serves as a very good template for testing themes), re-themed with whatever I've been able to garner—which sopvop says is called Ocean—as being a theme (colors, some borders and heading font) from haskell.org:

* [Ocean](http://tryhaskell.org/ocean/)

[Here is an icon font for Haskell.](http://tryhaskell.org/haskell-font/)

## Layout

The layout of the page is something that can come later and follow
naturally from the two points outlined above.
