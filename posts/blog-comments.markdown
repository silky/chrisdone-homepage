Comments are unsupported on my blog for the same reason as
[Dave Winer](http://www.scripting.com/2007/01/01.html#theUneditedVoiceOfAPerson)
gives:

Joel Spolsky first exposed me to the above. He elaborates
[in his blog](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/07/20.html):

If I wanted to have my expression shared and democratised I'd comment
on a forum.

People email me regarding my blog with ideas and errata/amendments
all the time, I'm glad for them, and I reply.
