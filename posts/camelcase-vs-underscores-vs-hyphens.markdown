## Snake-case: `do_and_go`

* 2 key presses per new component
* Chords involved: 1
* Doesn't use standard English compounding character
* Marginally aesthetically pleasing, but not normal typography

## Camel-case: `doAndGo`

* 2 key presses per new component
* Chords involved: n where n is the first character of the next component
* Non-standard upper-case
* Not aesthetically pleasing, like a camel's back

## Lisp-case: `do-and-go`

* 1 key press per new component
* Chords involved: 0
* Uses standard English compounding character: `-` (think:
  "type-class", "camel-case", "five-point", "computer-generated")
* Aesthetically pleasing, consistent height and separation
