I read
[this post](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/english-has-a-new-preposition-because-internet/281601/)
about the Internet joke construct “because <reason>”. And subsequently
the Hacker News comments
[below it](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6765099). It mildly
irks me, the lack of understanding about the context of this
joke. People wrongly think it's:

* Laziness on the part of the writer.
* Brevity on the part of the writer.
* Non-ironic on the part of the witer.

The whole point of is to act like a child or someone with no thoughts
to back them up. The lack of words _imitate your lack of
thoughts_. It's a non-sequitur to silence anyone capable of rational
inquiry.

* The government covered this up, because…
  ALIENS. [I'm grasping at straws because I have no other explanation.]
* Your article is wrong because
  reasons. [I disagree but I don't have/can't be bothered thinking up reasons.]
* This _because_ construction is now a valid construction because
  LINGUISTICS. [I'm an article about a word's usage and I'm blindly
  citing “linguists” as the reasons.]

The whole point is that it's ungramatical and without structure. It
bugs me a little bit that so-called linguists try to follow this stuff
but almost always seem to miss the actual sense.

It's the same as, “do want”, “do not want”, “not sure if want”. These
are _intentionally_ ungrammatical. They're not lazy or brief. They're
ironically mocking someone without the education or ability to string
a grammatical sentence together.
