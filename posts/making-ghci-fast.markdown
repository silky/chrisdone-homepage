A common complaint with GHCi is that it doesn't scale well when the
size of the project gets bigger. Once you hit 20, 30, 50, or 150
modules, it stops being fun anymore and you start wishing you didn't
have to wait for it to load.

I recommend enabling `-fobject-code`. This makes GHCi compile
everything once and then use incremental recompilation
thereafter. You'll find that you can load 100-module projects and work
with them just fine in this way.

After that, you may notice that loading some modules gives less type
information and general metadata than before. For that, re-enable
byte-compilation temporarily with `-fbyte-code` and `:load` that
module again, you now have fast recompilation with complete
information, too.

Another tip is to use `-fno-code` to have _really_ fast
compilation. This also works in combination with `-fobject-code`. But
I'd recommend using this only for type checking, not for getting
useful warnings (like pattern match inexhaustiveness). So I would
combine it with `-fobject-code` in the same way as above with
`-fbyte-code`, and then once you're done hacking, re-enable
`-fobject-code` and rebuild everything.
