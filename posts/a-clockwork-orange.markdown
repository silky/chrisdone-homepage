Kubrick took the American version of the book, missing the last
chapter (chapter 21 â€” get it?) of the original, in which Alex has an
epiphany and grows weary of ultraviolence after seeing one of his old
droogs in love and matured in a local cafe. The American publishers
thought ending on Alex having learned nothing and remaining evil would
appeal to an American audience more.

Burgess complained about this, Kubrick thought the last chapter was
"extra", because he hadn't read that version, and thought it was
"inconsistent with the rest of the book". Which is funny, because the
whole point of the book is that the youth of the nation are reckless,
violent brutes and then become older, grow up, only to be hounded on
by their own children. It's the cycle. Coming of age. If you leave
that out, all you have is a guy who likes to assault and rape people
for no reason or point. What have you learnt in watching it? That bad
people are always bad? Great.

I also don't remember a bunch of scenes from the book, e.g. the scenes
of Alex's interaction with prison in-mates (e.g after beating his
would-be-rapist to death he's sent for the therapy). I don't think it
was done even close to page-per-page. Just dribs and drabs of material
that Kubrick used to make a movie out of in his own vision. It's a
great movie, don't get me wrong. But it's clearly not by the book. In
Burgress's words:

> [A Clockwork Orange] became known as the raw material for a film which
> seemed to glorify sex and violence. The film made it easy for readers
> of the book to misunderstand what it was about, and the
> misunderstanding will pursue me until I die. I should not have written
> the book because of this danger of misinterpretation.
