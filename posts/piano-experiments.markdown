Over the past year I experimented with composing a few simple piano
pieces, inspired by atmospheres that conjure up images of wet spring
mornings, misty mountains and caves, rainy building entrances, eerie
uncanniness, with simple but effective compositions, by people like
Thomas Newman, Yann Tiersen or Kate Bush. Here are the pieces I
composed and my motivations and interpretations of their meaning.

If I were to make an album based on such a conceit, of a journey
through various kinds of atmospheres and feelings, the first piece
would undoubtedly be
[This World is Not What It Seems](https://soundcloud.com/chrisdone/this-world-is-not-what-it?in=chrisdone/sets/waking-moments-a-piano),
a track that sets a tone of warm simplicity but not without a light
breeze of the uncertain and dubious. Generally, I am happy with this
piece in its entirey. I could build upon this, extend it, or add
instruments (a bass violin wouldn't go amiss).

An entirely separate piece, but on the same theme could appear during
a more disturbing and dramatic piece of the journey, and that piece is
[The Nightmare](https://soundcloud.com/chrisdone/a-short-dream?in=chrisdone/sets/waking-moments-a-piano). A
fairly stereotypical cadence and intentional conflicting tones, gives
impressions of sinister unnaturalness, a clockwork order brought to
beings or objects things that should be gone. I could expand on this,
too.

A bittersweet and melancholic yet wistfully romantic piece is
[A Chance Meeting](https://soundcloud.com/chrisdone/a-chance-meeting-1?in=chrisdone/sets/waking-moments-a-piano)
which I made to give a feel of fleetingness, passing moments inbetween
daily drudgery—a stranger passes you by, you want to spark up a
conversion—but do you? I'm generally happy with this as a full
piece. I wouldn't want to expand it.

I piece that I'm particularly proud of for such a short and
uncomplicated sample is
[Man on the Stairway](https://soundcloud.com/chrisdone/creepy?in=chrisdone/sets/waking-moments-a-piano),
which was inspired from the short two liner poem: “Yesterday upon the
stair / I met a man who wasn’t there / He wasn’t there again today /
Oh, how I wish he’d go away” The melody (if one can call it that)
conjures feelings of confusion and fear—to me—and I like the
unconventional and unpredictable structure it takes. It makes you both
want to escape from it and also stay within it, like a scary story. I
could definitely expand upon this.

The minute collection of ideas named
[Happy Dream](https://soundcloud.com/chrisdone/happy-dream?in=chrisdone/sets/waking-moments-a-piano)
is a few peices. The first a blatant, but more playful and happy
version of the introduction to American Psycho, followed by a very
childlike patter, and then at the end an a racey skipping movement
that could certainly be expanded. I wouldn't mind expand this into a
whole track, though the conception draws largely from imitating common
“happy” piano tropes.

[The final piece](https://soundcloud.com/chrisdone/wool-wip?in=chrisdone/sets/waking-moments-a-piano)
I did was inspired by the science fiction novel, Wool. I've compressed
what I would like to make a thirty minute track into about two
minutes. It would consist of three parts, the atmospheric
calm-before-the-storm, the central dramatic point, followed by a quiet
period, ending in a dramatic stereotypical last-stand style
patter. I'm not entirely happy with the execution of the latter two
parts, but I like the theme I've created in the first part. I could
apply that as a general melody for a whole soundtrack, I think.

For future pieces I would rather like to have a proper MIDI keyboard
for composing more complex and layered pieces, as at the moment I'm
confined to a small portion of the keyboard. Overall, I'm quite
pleased with the melodies and atmospheres created above, and I'm
looking forward to getting a proper keyboard to really flesh out more
ideas and experiments.
