Had some free time this week, updated my blog to the latest Hakyll as
I've needed to update it for nearly a year. Eventually I was unable to
recompile it and was stuck keeping hold of a year old binary!

New repo is [here.](https://github.com/chrisdone/chrisdone-homepage)
Got a nice Cabal file, easy to install with cabal-dev.

I've tweaked it slightly by not following the date-in-the-filename
convention, and updated the sorting using [a field in the posts.](https://github.com/chrisdone/chrisdone-homepage/blob/8026113374e327e8ed1b3ec468ceed5e4c08171e/src/Main.hs#L88)
