Just messing about, here's [a Haskell.org design I whipped
up](http://chrisdone.com/designs/haskell/).

I always thought Haskell deserved a simple, elegant home
page. Unfortunately I can't do either of those things very well, but
that's the idea.

I was thinking what the target market for Haskell.org is, and I think
it's people who have never heard of Haskell. Haskell programmers, as
far as I'm aware, don't go on Haskell.org directly. They go on the
Wiki, or Hackage, and get updates via the mailing list.

But most programmers in the whole world have probably never heard of
Haskell, or don't know what it is. Most programmers I meet and talk to
ask me what it is. So, Haskellers don't actually visit the home page,
or, at least, it doesn't matter much what they see; Haskell.org is
purely for newbies, fresh faces who have never seen Haskell, ever.

So I wondered about what I as a newbie like to see on a programming
language home page, and what I came up with was:

* Examples and a way to try it; see it in action. I don't care about
buzzwords and claims (fast? scalable? robust? meaningless to me at
this point).
* I want to see what kind of language it is (imperative? strict? object oriented?) in a
list of points.
* Where I can get it and
* how I can learn it, and
* who to talk to while I'm learning it.
* I also want to know it's not dead. So I put the events there.

Also good would be to put a list of sponsors and businesses using or
backing that language (e.g. Galois, Well-Typed, Microsoft).

A list of projects using it would also be something I'd be interested
in.

I also figured, if it's basically an advertisement of the language,
*why not* have it all spaced out and self-indulgent? It sort of says,
we care about you using our language and we put effort into doing
things right and being professional.

Anyway, the current home page does the job fine so it will probably
stay like that forever until we switch technologies or something. I
just like to experiment with designs. Back to programming in it!
