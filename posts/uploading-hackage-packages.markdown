title: Uploading Hackage Packages
author: Chris Done
tags: haskell, hackage

I found two good Haskell libraries recently and realised they were not
packaged up and put on Hackage! So I updated them to the latest base
and GHC extensions, made a proper Cabal package out of them and
uploaded them:

* [frisby: Linear time composable parser for PEG grammars.](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/frisby)
* [pappy: Packrat parsing; linear-time parsers for grammars in TDPL.](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pappy)

If you have interest in being the maintainer of these packages, please
let me know.

Lots of people had not even heard of these two packages above before I
uploaded them to Hackage. So I am gonna go out on a limb and say
packaging up substantial code bases and putting them on Hackage should
be standard practice in the Haskell community.
