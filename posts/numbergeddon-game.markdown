[Here's a little game that I whipped](http://chrisdone.com/numbergeddon/)
up on my day off. A flying game in which you destroy your enemies by
typing in the answers to trivial arithmetic above their heads. It's
aimed at kids.

Controls: Use `wsad` or the arrow keys, and the numpad to type in
answers/hit return to submit.

Tested on: Chrome/Chromium 10 and Firefox 4. It's not the fastest code
so it varies between being totally smooth and not really playable on
Firefox. On Chrome it's always smooth.
