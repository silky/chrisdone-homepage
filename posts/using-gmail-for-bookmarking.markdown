title: Using GMail for bookmarking

I have [this link](http://hpaste.org/raw/56662) in my Bookmarks toolbar
in Chrome. It pops up GMail composer in another window and pre-fills
the recipient, subject and body with me, the page title, and the
link.

When it hits my inbox, it's tagged as Bookmark. The fact that it hits
my inbox is sure that I will actually see it and look at the link at
some point.

Later I can tag the email with (various) categories for easier
browsing later. I have about a hundred bookmarks so far, 19 are marked
unread, as I've chosen that I don't intend on reading them soon, but
marked that I haven't read them. [A screenshot of the first page of my
bookmarks.](http://img546.imageshack.us/img546/2435/gmailbookmarks.png)

If someone has given me a link to see, I'll bookmark it in this way
and then keep it in my inbox until I've looked at it. This system
seems to work well for me.
