I've created a series of videos explaining structured-haskell-mode;
how it works and the feature-set
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QMBVMMmaCU&list=PLlzKKtH5TyE-R-k86na3bLSNaKflFNRZr). While
the
[Github repository's README](https://github.com/chrisdone/structured-haskell-mode)
shows a series of animations showing off the features, I've observed
that this, while pretty and impressive, isn't particularly useful to
explain to people the intended use of SHM and what to expect. People
really need to see features in context with explanation. This set of
videos explains all the features and keybindings.
