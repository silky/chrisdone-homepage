Here are some little poems I've written. All of my poems are
uninteresting, cliché, rhyming and bad puns. But I have fun making
them and that's what poetry is about, to me.

## One-liner

*Long have the wronged longed to wrong the wrong.*

Poor attempt to sum up the cycle of hate.

## Going to bed / getting up

*The world and more with sleepy head,*
*stop will I not till I'm dead,*
*creaky feet touch cold floor,*
*it doesn't matter anymore.*

Sums up the way I imagine all sorts of projects and activities for the
future when I'm sleepy, when I get up in the morning none of it seems
to matter much.

## Wind

*Feel that wind? Consider*
*The rushing spirits*
*Of leaves and hill-sides,*
*Crashing under trees, over turrets,*
*Bouncing across rivers, their eyes*
*Searching in nooks and crannies,*
*Giving shivers, turning pages of books,*
*It sucks, and whistles,*
*To and from, here and gone.*

Don't know.

## Writing

*I want to write*
*to gorge on the fruits*
*of the dead tree.*

I liked the pun of dead tree/book.

## Little concept

*She approaches the river alone*
*She has never waded fresh water*
*She cannot swim*
*She does not perceive the tide*
*She does not see the other side*
*She steps in*

I knew what this was about at the time I wrote it, now I have no idea.

## Nerves and crap

*Are not these excited nerves of we*
*That feed on cream and root of glee*
*Sated not by silk and sound*
*Nor coloured leaves and earthy ground*
*No huff or sniff of fresh cut grass*
*Our kettles hiss, a brew at last*
*And what to speak of but our love*
*Of crooked visions; perverse, a frenzy*
*That which we deem to be scary*
*Of disgust depart our thoughts*
*The dark unknown that is sought*
*For truth and knowing of ourselves*
*Or entertainment—hey, it sells!*
*Either way, the sword is split*
*To wit, it sits, on two blades, fit.*

Just fun with rhyming, doesn't mean anything.

## Gaze

*Wait a moment, clocking visions,*
*past or side-ways; peripheral divisions,*
*catch a handful, pull it direct,*
*facing, zooming, leaving the rest,*
*what's this? I look upon a*
*nothing, an absense of,*
*a sweet without, a lack of anything,*
*transparent, circular inside the lens,*
*discard the rest, focus up to see*
*my mind's eye,*
*they're darting, stabbing at never-there,*
*all comprising the wonderful,*
*senseful,*
*vacant stare.*

Little ditty about that vacant stare you have sometimes.

## The House Spider

*I wait—sit, sleep, watch, feel, sense,*
*what have you, another month I'll wait here hence,*
*scuttling? maybe, or weaving in the dark,*
*I scoot across, or up and down,*
*gravity has no meaning here,*
*surface is not the only tension, and my*
*hunger for a taste of flesh, to wrap it up,*
*and suck it fresh,*
*all sense and order, they flee*
*for what instinct brings for me, but She*
*the one I seek,*
*in autumn cool I approach, meek,*
*my desire, ancient species dance,*
*entering, feeling, I take my chance,*
*my life, its purpose, these textures, gone*
*the embrace with She,*
*bound, connected, we fill with lust,*
*I thrust, we must,*
*within the dust,*
*her fleshy torso turns to me,*
*eyes staring, post-ecstasy,*
*my loving warmth, this tender moment,*
*without a thought, sets upon*
*my smaller frame,*
*advances, then*
*takes me for game,*
*mouths and hands and legs and feet,*
*my crippled carcass, she starts to eat.*

Pretty self-explanatory. The breeding ritual of spiders is interesting.

## Others

A poem that isn't mine but that I love:

*Yesterday upon the stair*
*I met a man who wasn’t there*
*He wasn’t there again today*
*Oh, how I wish he’d go away*

I can't top that.
