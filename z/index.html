    <h1>A tiny language called Z</h1>
    <p>A tiny, strict, impure, curried, dynamically typed (although
      that may change), partially
      applied language with rather peculiar syntax.</p>
    <h2>Markdown’s insight</h2>
    <p>
        First, I want you to recall Markdown. You've seen it even if
        you haven't ever written any. And you'll know that there's a
        particular feature in the Markdown syntax, which is how to
        embed code. It's exceedingly simple; obvious,
        even: <strong>you indent your code four spaces, and then you
        can write whatever you want!</strong>
  </p>
        <pre>Hello world! Here comes some code!

    Here is some arbitrary code! f.x()/f23(); // Zaha!

And now we're back to normal text...</pre>

<p>
What I realised was special about this idea, is that you can
put <em>anything</em> in there. And it doesn't affect, in <em>any
way</em> the source code surrounding it! Now, that is a very powerful
idea. Let me show you what I mean.
</p>

<h2>Z-expressions</h2>
<p>I'm going to show you a tiny language called “Z” which I have used
  to illustrate the concept.
</p>
<p>Z has very, very simple syntax. Weird, but simple. Here's how it
works, function application is of the following form:</p>
<pre>name argument</pre>
    <p>And that's taken <em>to an extreme</em>, because this code,</p>
    <pre>foo bar mu zot</pre>
    <p>actually groups like this:</p>
    <pre>foo (bar (mu zot))</pre>
    <p><small>(Note: there are no parentheses in Z. Zero.)</small></p>
<p>Which, if you think about it, is the natural grouping for the
  definition of the <code>name argument</code> syntax I gave
  above.</p>
  <p>To pass additional arguments to a function, the arguments are put on
    the next line and indented to the column of the first
    argument:</p>
    <pre>foo bar
    mu
    zot </pre>

    <p>This means that the function <code>foo</code> has three
      arguments. This rule applies <strong>everywhere</strong>, so I can, of course,
    write:</p>
    <pre>foo bar mu
        zot
    bob</pre>
    <p>This means that the function <code>foo</code> has two
      arguments, and the function <code>bar</code> has two
      arguments.</p>
    <p>I call these “z-expressions”. Lisp is curly, curvy. It has its
    s-expressions. Z is jagged and sharp. And weird.</p>

    <p>Special operators follow the same rules. Now I'll show you
    some of those special operators.</p>

    <h2>Z’s built-in operators</h2>
    <p>The <code>defun</code> special operator takes two arguments: a
    list of names, the first of which is the name of the function, and
      a body for the function. Here's a function
    that <em>appends</em> two lists:</p>

<pre><span class="keyword">defun</span> ap x y
      ++ x
         y</pre>

    <p>All Z functions are curried and partially applied, like in
    Haskell, so the above is equivalent to</p>
<pre><span class="keyword">def</span> ap
    <span class="keyword">fn</span> x
       <span class="keyword">fn</span> y
          ++ x
             y</pre>

    <p>but that doesn't matter for this introduction. We also
      have <code>if</code> and <code>do</code>:</p>

<pre><span class="keyword">if</span> foo
   bar
   mu

<span class="keyword">do</span> this
   that
   those</pre>

<p>Note, if you will, that these special operators interpret their
  arguments in a non-function normal-order way. They interpret their
  arguments syntactically!</p>

    <p>We also have some number <code>123</code>
      syntax, <code>"strings"</code> and <code>unit</code>, as in
      nothing, null, empty, voidness, niente.</p>

<h2>Defining macros</h2>

    <p>Aha! La pièce de résistance! We also have
    a <code>defmacro</code> operator with the specific task of
    allowing us to define new syntax. Observe…</p>

<pre>
<span class="keyword">defmacro</span> -- _
         <span class="string">"unit"</span>
</pre>

    <p>Voilà! We have defined the name <code>--</code> which will
      take an argument <code>_</code> and return the
      string <code>"unit"</code>. </p>

<p>All macros take in a string, which is all the source code that can
  be arguments to it, which, as we know, is done by indenting. And all
  macros output a string that will be put in place of that macro call,
  and will be <em>re-parsed</em> by the language.</p>

    <p>In the case of our <code>--</code> macro, however, we're just
      returning <code>unit</code>, a no-op. We've <strong>defined our
        own comment syntax.</strong></p>

<pre>
<span class="comment">-- A simple function, that is used inside the macro below.</span>
<span class="keyword">defun</span> ap x y
      ++ x
         y
</pre>

<p>Tada! There's a function with a comment! That comment syntax, we just
  made it up! We can also use this
  function, <code>ap</code> <em>inside</em> other macros, which is
  typical of the Lisp family of languages. And now let's do that, and
  define a more complicated macro:</p>

<h2>The <code>when</code> macro</h2>

<pre>
<span class="comment">-- A messy macro (because it uses string manipulation),</span>
<span class="comment">   but demonstrates the idea well enough.</span>
<span class="keyword">defmacro</span> when input
         <span class="keyword">fn</span> blocks
            ap <span class="string">"if"</span>
               ++ <span class="constant">z:indent-before</span> 3
                                  car blocks
                  ++ <span class="string">"\n"</span>
                     ++ <span class="constant">z:indent</span> 3
                                 car cdr blocks
                        ++ <span class="string">"\n"</span>
                           <span class="constant">z:indent</span> 3
                                    <span class="string">"unit"</span>
            <span class="constant">z:blocks</span> input
</pre>

<p>Here we can see that I have provided some helper functions for
  getting the set of “blocks”—i.e. arguments in an application—and I'm
  passing that to the anonymous function starting at <code>fn
    blocks</code>, then I am constructing a string which is
  returned.</p>

    <p>Can you tell the aim of this macro? It's to let us write this:</p>

<pre>when = 1
       1
     print ++ <span class="string">"The number is: "</span>
              when true
                   show 123
</pre>

    <p>See how it looks native? Macros within macros are fine!</p>

    <h2>The string macro</h2>

    <p>A common problem in programming is how to write strings of
    text in a non-annoying way. Often we put up with our strange ways
    of escaping strings. In Z, you don't have to!</p>

    <p>This is the normal way to use strings:</p>
    <pre> print <span class="string">"Hai, guys!"</span></pre>
    <p>Here we define a macro to make writing strings easier,
      called <code>:</code>, it's meant to read like typical English,
 and lets you write arbitrary text as long as it's
 indented to the offside column.</p>

<pre><span class="keyword">defmacro</span> : input
         <span class="constant">z:string</span> input</pre>

<p>Here I provided a utility to make a <code>string</code>
into <code>"string"</code>, so that whatever is passed
as <code>input</code> into the macro will be returned verbatim, but in
  string syntax. Ready? LOOK NOW!</p>

<pre><span class="comment">-- Example with print:</span>
print : Hello, World!
        What's going on in here? </pre>

Isn't that just wonderful? It reads like a script! And <em>that</em>,
is exactly the insight that Markdown had. Again, it works just fine
with other function application:

<pre>
<span class="keyword">defun</span> message msg
      <span class="keyword">do</span> print : Here's a message
         print msg
         print : End of message. </pre>

    <p>And you can use it:</p>

<pre>message ap : Hello,
           ++ <span class="string">" World! "</span>
              : Love ya! </pre>



   <p>Except you wouldn't write it like that, you'd just write:</p>
<pre>message <span class="string">: Everybody dance now!</span></pre>

<h2>Defining some functions</h2>

<p>Enough awesome for now. Let's take a breather from all that
  excitement and look at some boring pure functions. This is what
  code in Z looks like.</p>

<pre><span class="comment">-- Map function.</span>
<span class="keyword">defun</span> map f xs
      <span class="keyword">if</span> unit? xs
         unit
         cons f car xs
              map f
                  cdr xs

<span class="comment">-- ["foo","bar"] &#8594; foo\nbar\n </span>
<span class="keyword">defun</span> unlines xs
      <span class="keyword">if</span> unit? xs
         <span class="string">""</span>
         ++ car xs
            ++ <span class="string">"\n"</span>
               unlines cdr xs

<span class="comment">-- Take the first n elements of list xs.</span>
<span class="keyword">defun</span> take n xs
      <span class="keyword">if</span> = n
           0
         unit
         <span class="keyword">if</span> unit? xs
            unit
            cons car xs
                 take - n
                        1
                      cdr xs

<span class="comment">-- Take all but the last element of a list.</span>
<span class="keyword">defun</span> init xs
      <span class="keyword">if</span> unit? xs
         unit
         <span class="keyword">if</span> unit? cdr xs
            unit
            cons car xs
                 init cdr xs

<span class="comment">-- Take the last element of a list, or return a default.</span>
<span class="keyword">defun</span> last def xs
      <span class="keyword">if</span> unit? xs
         def
         <span class="keyword">if</span> unit? cdr xs
            car xs
            last def
                 cdr xs
</pre>

    <p>Isn't programming without pattern matching completely boring!?
    Sadly, we won't be defining a pattern matching syntax in Z today,
    because writing a decent pattern macher is non-trivial. And
    writing a crappy one is embarassing.</p>
    <p>So we can use those functions, and all works as expected:</p>
    <pre>
<span class="comment">-- Print the blocks of foo and bar with ! on the end.</span>
print unlines map <span class="keyword">fn</span> x
                     ++ x
                        <span class="string">"!"</span>
                  <span class="constant">z:blocks</span> : foo
                             bar

<span class="comment">-- Use of take function.</span>
print unlines take 3
                   <span class="constant">z:blocks</span> : foo
                              bar
                              mu
                              zot
</pre>

    <h2>Regular expressions</h2>

    <p>Here's another, easy use-case for macros: regular
    expressions! Let's experiment a little.</p>

    <p>Our basic regex functions from the standard library
      are <code>regex:match</code>
      and <code>regex:new</code>. And <code>regex:match</code> returns
      a list of matches as marked by the <code>(foo)</code> syntax of
      regular expressions.</p>
<pre>print regex:match regex:new <span class="string">"(abc)"</span>
                  <span class="string">"abc"</span>
</pre>

    <p>We're already macro <em>coin</em>nnoisseurs (<em>get it?</em>)
    by this point, so let's dabble with some nicer syntax:</p>

<pre><span class="keyword">defun</span> ~~ regex string
      regex:match regex
                  string

print ~~ regex:new <span class="string">"(def)"</span>
         <span class="string">"defghi"</span>
</pre>
    <p>What do we think? Not bad? It's shorter to write the match, at
    least. But building the regex is still cumbersome. Let's make a
    macro for that!</p>

<pre><span class="keyword">defmacro</span> rx input
         ++ <span class="string">"regex:new "</span>
            <span class="constant">z:string</span> input

print ~~ rx <span class="string">Age: (.*)</span>
         <span class="string">"Age: 123"</span>
</pre>
    <p>Bit nicer, but not <em>amazing</em>.</p>
    <p>Let's maybe skip the whole composing part and merge in the
    matching together:</p>
<pre>
<span class="keyword">defmacro</span> ~ input
         <span class="keyword">fn</span> blocks
            ++ <span class="string">"~~ rx"</span>
               ++ <span class="constant">z:indent-before</span> 6
                                  unlines init blocks
                  ++ <span class="string">"\n"</span>
                     <span class="constant">z:indent</span> 3
                              last <span class="string">""</span>
                                   blocks
            <span class="constant">z:blocks</span> input

print ~ <span class="string">Age: (.*)</span>
        <span class="string">"Age: 666"</span>
</pre>

    <p><em>Now</em> we're cooking with gas! That looks like a million
      dollars, pre-recession!</p>

<pre>print ~ <span class="string">Age: (.*)
        ([a-z]+)</span>
        <span class="string">"Age: 777\nlalala"</span>
</pre>
    <p>Oh, fancy that, we can even write multi-line regexes. God
    damn, that's some delicious awesome sauce. Can I get another
    bottle, waiter?</p>

<pre>print ~ <span class="string">Age: (.*)
        ([a-z]+)</span>
        : <span class="string">Age: 999
          beep!</span>
</pre>

    <p>Ah, of course. It even works with other macros. How's that for
    a slice of fried gold?</p>

    <h2>Editing</h2>

<p>Another aspect of Z-expressions which is totally suave is that
  editing it can largely be made trivial. Question: how do you
  capture the starting and ending positions of the current node in
  Lisp or any other language?</p>

<pre>(lorem ipsum-lorem-ipsum ()
  (foo-bar)
  (let* ((zot (biff-pop))
         (zar-zar (beep "%s.bill" bob)))
    (if (ben-bill-bocky doo-dar)
        (let*<strong>|</strong> ((foo (foo-bar-mu-zot))
               (bar (ipsum-lorem))
               (ipsum (cdr (assoc 'cakes lorem)))
               (lorem (cdr (assoc 'potato lorem)))
               (ipsum (cdr (assoc 'ipsum lorem)))
               (lorem (cdr (assoc 'lorem lorem))))
          (if bob
              (progn
                (bill ben)
                (the cake is a lie)
                (the game))
            (message "Structural integrity is not secured.")))
      (message "Data, because it's polite." cakes))))</pre>


      <p>If you're just after the let, what do you do? The usual
        thing. You start looking for a start parenthesis. You find
        it. Then you start walking forward, looking for a closing
        parenthesis. Every time you encounter an opening parenthesis, you
        push it onto a stack. Every time you encounter a closing one, you
        pop it off the stack. Unless you encounter an opening string, or
        character escape, in which case you wait until you encounter
        another, non-escaped string, and continue… Sorry, was I
        boring you? Yeah, me too. I thought I could make it, but I
        can't.</p>


<p>However, in Z. It's easy. You go to the starting column, identified
  by the first non-whitespace character. Then you go up and down a line
  and do the same thing until the starting column is not equal to or
  greater than this one. Done. You have the whole z-expression. You
  want to move it? Easy, you cut it out and paste it, and add or
  remove spaces according to the new offset. Worried about
  indentation styles? There are non in Z. It's impossible to have
  indentation styles. There is only one indentation.</p>


    <h2>Future Work</h2>
    <h3>Quasiquotations</h3>

<p>We would be nothing if we did not learn from history. And Lisp has
  a lot of history, and it has taught us about quotation and
  quasiquotation, and how convenient it can be over strings. And I
  agree. That's why, next, I will implement this syntax:</p>

<pre><span class="keyword">defmacro</span> when cond body
         <span class="keyword"><strong>`</strong></span> if <span class="keyword">,</span> cond
              <span class="keyword">,</span> body
              unit
</pre>

<p>Of course, it follows the same syntactical pattern as all
  Z-expressions, but the same semantics as in Lisp. However, this is
  merely syntactic sugar. The real power in Z lies in its reliance on
  indentation to denote regions of text.</p>

<h3>A “math” macro</h3>

<p>In Z, you indent for many-argument functions. That can be boring for
functions involved in maths, for which the arguments are often simple,
other expressions of the same order. For that, a math macro is
  entirely appropriate. For example, <code>#</code>:</p>

<pre><span class="keyword">def</span> x # x²-y²×(2xy+x²-y²×(2xy+c))
</pre>

    <p>Why not?</p>

    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p>There's an
    implementation <a href="https://github.com/chrisdone/z">here</a>,
    but I wouldn't try it, it's too <strike>buggy</strike> awesome for
    you, I'd just look at it, and try to imagine the bodacious vibes
      kicking off it. Alright?</p>
